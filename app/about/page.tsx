            Vetra was born from a simple belief: that great content deserves great presentation. 
            In a world filled with cluttered designs and overwhelming interfaces, we wanted to 
            create something differentâ€”a blog template that puts your words first.
          </p>

          <p>
            Our minimalist approach isn't about having less; it's about having exactly what you need. 
            Every element in Vetra has been carefully considered to enhance readability, improve 
            user experience, and create a space where ideas can breathe.

            Our Design Philosophy
          </h2>

          <p>
            We believe that good design is invisible. When readers visit your blog, they shouldn't 
            be distracted by fancy animations or complex layouts. Instead, they should feel drawn 
            into your content, able to focus completely on your ideas and insights.
          </p>

          <p>
            Vetra achieves this through:
          </p>

          <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 ml-4">
            <li>Generous white space that gives content room to breathe</li>
            <li>Carefully chosen typography that enhances readability</li>
            <li>A cohesive color system that creates visual harmony</li>
            <li>Thoughtful categorization that helps readers discover related content</li>
            <li>Responsive design that works beautifully on any device</li>
          </ul>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 dark:text-white mt-8 mb-4">
            Built for Creators
          </h2>

          <p>

            observations, or big ideas, Vetra provides the perfect foundation for your content.

            performance, accessibility, and SEO.
